Kelli Templeton Update Log

9/16/19 Update:

1. Tested the UART retrieval and parsing code for the MCU-GSM integration (uploaded code today 9/16/19)
2. Finalized the web application (will upload code by end of week)
3. Created the initial physical container
4. Began the design of the mobile PCB.

9/18/19 Update:

1. Integrated GSM module with Arduino MCU successfully (uploaded GSM and Arduino code today 9/18/19) 

9/22/19 Update:

1. Integrated GSM module with ODROID successfully

9/26/19 Update:

1. Validated connection of ODROID and GSM module
2. Wrote initial camera integration code
3. Wrote initial code to pull sensor data and format it into expected string

10/3/19 Update:

1. Tested and Improved Camera Integration

10/14/19 Update:

1. Installed all correct image processing dependencies on ODROID
2. Succesfully ran image processing model on ODROID
3. Wrote, tested, and finalized code to pull data from main module sensors every 5 minutes
4. Wrote initial code to pull data from gps module and remote module
5. Wrote initial code for camera - image processing model integration

10/24/19 Update:

1. Final testing and integration of code that pulls data from sensors every 5 minutes
2. Final testing of camera and image processing integration code
3. Discovered that the serial pin for the connection from the odroid to the gsm was dead - corrected the problem by adding USB to serial converter and implemented that successfully
4. Discovered that looping the image processing and camera code would create a memory allocation error
5. Solved the problem with a bash script that will build and break down the python code upon each loop
6. Modified sensor c code
7. Wrote tested and finalized code to pull data from gps and remote module 
8. Successfully ran full integration code from sensors, gps, and remote module to gsm module and web application
9. HIT SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION BENCHMARK!

10/28/19 Update:

1. Fabricated device container
2. Validated Sensors
3. Wrote tested and finalized code for resetting GSM module off of PCB
