- This last week I ordered and tested the two Omron SSRs and dc/dc converter to validate they would work for my use. 
- I have been working on the PCB design for my romote sensor module and hope to have it done by 09/19
- I plan to have the PCB ordered and hopefully begin testing next week
- I plan to work on GPS integration this next week
