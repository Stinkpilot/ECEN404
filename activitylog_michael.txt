- This last week I ordered and tested the two Omron SSRs and dc/dc converter to validate they would work for my use. 
- I have been working on the PCB design for my romote sensor module and hope to have it done by 09/19
- I plan to have the PCB ordered and hopefully begin testing next week
- I plan to work on GPS integration this next week

- This last week I finalized my PCB design for the remote sensor module and ordered it on 9/20
- I have been working on integration of the GPS module with the ODOID
- I plan to work on validating the PCB once recieved and mounting all necesary components
- I plan to have the GPS integrated with the ODOID over the next week

 - This last week I recieved my PCB and begun testing/soft fitting of components
 - I ordered the remaining components for my PCB (sockets for the ICs, caps, etc.)
 - I wrote C code for opening serial port and reading GPS data from the module
 - Sucessfully tested my code on the odroid with the gps module
 - I plan to mount all the components and begin validation of my subsystem
 - I plan to begin working on integration of the RF module with the odroid

- This last week I soldered all the components to the remote sensor module PCB
- This last week I tested functionality of several of the components 
- I plan to begin validating functionality of the module in the coming weeks
- I plan to integrate the RF module with the odroid in the coming weeks

- This last week I finished polishing of the GPS code and completed integration
- Board from EDC had an issue requiring reordering so I fixed some issues and reordered from 4pcb it on monday (10/14)
- I plan to integrate the RF module with the odroid in the today :(
- I plan to begin validating functionality of the module in the coming weeks
